## Development Tools ##

The following tools are used.
* Java 8 JDK or better - For Java development
* Android Studio - For Android development
   * On the CSE Linux machines you may need to install binaries for running 32-bit tools by following command:
   ```
   sudo yum install glibc.i686 zlib.i686 libstdc++.i686 ncurses-libs.i686 libgcc.i686
   ```
* Genymotion - Not required, but it is a better, faster emulator for Android
* VirtualBox - Genymotion's virtual machine


## Importing the Android project into Android Studio ##

1. Open Android Studio
2. If prompted with the welcome screen, select "Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)"
3. If not, go to File -> Import Project

6. If the build fails, check for the errors in build tab.


## Android Studio Plugins ##

### Android Size Analyzer ###
We used this tool to analyze the apk size of our application. It will remove the unnecessary code statements in the project reducing its size about 40%.  
To use, 
* Install Java 8 on your machine, go to File -> Project Structure -> SDK Location and set JDK location to the location of your Java 8 JDK. 
* Go to settings -> plugins and install android size analyzer.
* In the build tab, go to analyze code.


### Lint ###
The lint tool checks your Android project source files for potential bugs and optimization improvements for correctness, security, performance, usability, accessibility, and internationalization.  
To add lint in project, create a script-lint.gradle file. 
```
android{
    lintOptions{
        lintConfig file("$project.rootDir/tools/rules-lint.xml")
        htmlOutput file("$project.buildDir/outputs/lint/lint.html")
        warningsAsErrors true
        xmlReport false
    }
}
```
Import script-lint.gradle to your build.gradle file.



## Directory Structure ##

* app/src/main -Folder for main source code.
   * AndroidManifest.xml - Manifest file.
   * java/com/example/garbage - Folder containing main java files.
* app/release - Signed apk file for project.
* app/build/outputs/apk/debug - Build apk file for project.
